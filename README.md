## Usage
Draw some shapes, turn them into softbodies, and then squish them.

To start drawing, run the main.py file, then hold left click and drag. The radius of your brush is shown by the size of the blue circle around your mouse. The size of your brush can be changed by scrolling up and down.

You can also make shapes by drawing outlines first, and then pressing F in the center of your shape to fill.

Once you're done with your shape(s), press enter to calculate the softbody particles. You can press enter again at any point in time to recalculate the particles if you make any changes.
